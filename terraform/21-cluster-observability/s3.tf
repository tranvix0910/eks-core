# Object storage for Mimir (metric blocks) and Loki (log chunks + index).
#
# Both charts support filesystem storage on a PVC, which would be simpler to
# wire up - no bucket, no Pod Identity, no IAM policy. Not used here because
# it silently caps this at exactly the node the pod landed on: no replication,
# and a node replacement (upgrade, AZ issue) loses every block that had not
# been part of a manual backup. S3 costs nothing extra to set up correctly the
# first time and removes that failure mode entirely.
